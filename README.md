# EDP Repository

This repository contains the code for Practical Works 1 (TP1) and 2 (TP2) related to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in the context of pricing financial options.

## Practical Works

### TP1: Pricing European Options

In the context of TP1, we have implemented the following methods for pricing European options:
- Explicit Euler (EE)
- Implicit Euler (IE)
- Crank-Nicolson (CR)

The source code for each method can be found in the corresponding folder.

### TP2: Pricing American Options

TP2 focuses on pricing American options using various methods, including:
- Explicit Euler (EE)
- Implicit Euler (IE)
- PSOR (Projected Successive Over-Relaxation) Algorithm
- Semi-Smooth Newton Algorithm
- Brennan and Schwartz Algorithm
- Crank-Nicolson (CR)
- BDF (Backward Differentiation Formula) Algorithm

## How to Use the Code

Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies before running the code.
